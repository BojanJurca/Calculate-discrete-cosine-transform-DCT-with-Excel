# Calculate-discrete-cosine-transform-DCT-with-Excel


This repository demonstrates how to calculate the **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** using Microsoft Excel.  
It provides an implementation of DCT formulas directly in spreadsheets, making it possible to experiment with signal processing concepts without programming.
